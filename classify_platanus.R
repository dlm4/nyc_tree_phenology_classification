# Make a script that loads in a subset of the tree database for a neighborhood with likely a lot of Platanus unmapped
# Use existing extracted point phenology data + lidar polygon variables (and temperature?? perhaps not needed) to train random forest
# Ranger (random forest) training for binary classifier of Platanus / not Platanus (very simple)
# Apply back onto unmapped trees in neighborhood for binary classifier demonstration
